     * @dev Possible indexes of hooks that are used to apply additional external actions during some operation steps.
     *
     * Those actions are triggered through the hook function that are implemented in external contracts and
     * called by the PixCashier contract at concrete moments.
     * The index of the hook is passed to the hook function to indicate when it was called.
     *
     * The possible values:
     *
     * - CashInCommonBefore -------- Called before the token transfer during a common cash-in operation.
     * - CashInCommonAfter --------- Called before the token transfer during a common cash-in operation.
     * - CashInPremintBefore ------- Called before the token transfer during a premint cash-in operation.
     * - CashInPremintAfter -------- Called after the token transfer during a premint cash-in operation.
     * - Reserved1 ----------------- Reserved for the future.
     * - Reserved2 ----------------- Reserved for the future.
     * - CashOutRequestBefore ------ Called before the token transfer during a cash-out request operation.
     * - CashOutRequestAfter ------- Called after the token transfer during a cash-out request operation.
     * - CashOutConfirmationBefore - Called before the token transfer during a cash-out confirmation operation.
     * - CashOutConfirmationAfter -- Called after the token transfer during a cash-out confirmation operation.
     * - CashOutReversalBefore ----- Called before the token transfer during a cash-out reversal operation.
     * - CashOutReversalAfter ------ Called after the token transfer during a cash-out reversal operation.
     *
     * Notes:
     *
     * - 1. Hooks with indexes from 0 to 5 including are not used in the current implementation.
     * - 2. The hook with index `CashOutConfirmationAfter` is not called during internal cash-out operations.
     * - 3. An example of the code to convert a `HookIndex` value to bit flags:
     *
     *    ```solidity
     *    uint256 flag1 = 1 << uint256(HookIndex.CashOutRequestBefore);
     *    uint256 flag2 = 1 << uint256(HookIndex.CashOutConfirmationAfter);
     *    uint256 flag3 = 1 << uint256(HookIndex.CashOutReversalAfter);
     *    uint256 flags = flag1 + flag2 + flag3;
     *    ```
